00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,510
Hello and welcome to this short

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,950
video, which will be an introduction to

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:08,910
one of the most exciting and

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,670
important projects of

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,630
 2025. This, ladies and

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,550
gentlemen, is Crypto C

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,710
Vest.

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,540
OK, I'm Cryptosy. I have

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:24,420
developed and built

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,780
platforms such as Bidify and Vulcan

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,620
Launchpad. I am one of the

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,140
first members of the Cryptosy

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,900
Dow which fingers crossed will be

14
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,380
funding a portion of the development

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,140
of this project as it will be receiving a

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,261
portion of the fees for this project

17
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,161
but. What is the project, why does it

18
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:49,071
exist, and how we're going to build it?So

19
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:51,071
first of all, Kryptosi Vest will

20
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:53,991
be a customizable vesting

21
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:56,911
platform. The idea being that you

22
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:59,751
allow developers, or anyone really,

23
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,551
to vest their tokens and

24
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,791
have them released at varying

25
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,871
times and over

26
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,071
varying schedules now.

27
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,241
This is not anything that is new.

28
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:14,921
However, the way we're going to be doing

29
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,241
it is going to be unique. So the USPS,

30
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,961
the unique selling points for this

31
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,911
particular platform. Will be twofold.

32
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:24,591
First of all, we will have a price

33
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:27,151
triggering mechanism. This means that

34
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:30,111
devs can put their portion

35
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,031
of the supply into cryptosy vest

36
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,751
and it will not be released until the

37
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:37,031
project reaches a certain milestone.

38
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:39,911
The reason behind this thinking behind

39
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:41,911
this is that it will incentivize the

40
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,511
developers to get the price of

41
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:47,191
their particular token up to a certain.

42
00:01:48,361 --> 00:01:51,281
Value before they can realise any of the

43
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:53,671
benefits. It means they will be working

44
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,871
for the community until such a point as

45
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,791
they have achieved their job for the

46
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,671
community, which will be getting their

47
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:03,311
hope into a particular price. Of course,

48
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:05,192
there is some game theory here which does

49
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,992
say that when they get it to that price,

50
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:08,752
what's to say that they won't just dump

51
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:10,512
it immediately? So will people. Or will

52
00:02:10,512 --> 00:02:12,272
we always be selling just below that

53
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,232
price? Of course you can always.

54
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,432
Well not of course, but you will be able

55
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:20,272
to move your tokens

56
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:22,752
with invested project to. Higher

57
00:02:22,752 --> 00:02:24,752
price, but you will not be able to move

58
00:02:24,752 --> 00:02:27,632
them to a lower price. So what we

59
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:30,312
probably will see happen, as we haven't

60
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:32,112
seen that unfold yet, is we may see

61
00:02:32,112 --> 00:02:34,912
developers move a small portion of their

62
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,072
or a big portion of their holdings at a

63
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:39,432
certain price up to another price

64
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:41,272
before their prices hit.

65
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:44,992
This will give the community the.

66
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,122
The knowledge that the developer is

67
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:50,962
still evolved and he's still

68
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,952
incentivizing himself. To keep on pushing

69
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,912
higher and higher, the second unique

70
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,152
selling point of Cryptosyfest will be the

71
00:02:59,152 --> 00:03:00,992
fee structure. What we're going to do is

72
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,872
we're going to have currently, so this

73
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:05,472
this may be subject to change, but

74
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:08,232
currently we're looking to have a 5%

75
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,952
fee, which will be a flat fee

76
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:13,392
for all vested and will not be paid out

77
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:16,032
until such a time as the token has

78
00:03:16,032 --> 00:03:18,962
reached its price target. Or is

79
00:03:18,962 --> 00:03:21,282
being released if it's just a regular

80
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:24,082
linear or Cliff scheduling so

81
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:26,722
it won't only be price. You can have lock

82
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,843
up my tokens for six months or 12 months.

83
00:03:29,153 --> 00:03:31,033
And then release them one month at a time

84
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:32,513
like regular schedule. It that's the

85
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:35,113
case, the fees don't get released until

86
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,473
the tokens are being released. The

87
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:40,033
fee structure will have

88
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,313
two components to it. There will be a

89
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:45,753
 2.5% flat fee which

90
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,393
goes only.

91
00:03:49,123 --> 00:03:51,243
To the cryptosy down. I'm not quite sure

92
00:03:51,243 --> 00:03:52,763
what that special effect was just there

93
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:55,723
behind me, but there will be a 2.5%

94
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,043
fee which goes only to the cryptosyll

95
00:03:58,243 --> 00:04:00,803
that will fund further developments by

96
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:03,283
the crypto sidel maintenance

97
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:05,833
for the. Bidify

98
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:08,153
platform for Vulcan, Launchpad for

99
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,313
Cryptosyves, for all of those things

100
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:12,353
moving forward. And there will also be a

101
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:15,273
 2.5% fee which

102
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:17,793
is given to the vestin

103
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:20,473
partner, which means every

104
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:23,113
time a developer decides the vest, if he

105
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:24,673
does it through a vesting partners

106
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,153
website, that website will be

107
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:30,123
eligible to claim. Their

108
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:33,003
 2.5% of the rested tokens upon

109
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:35,403
their release at the release time.

110
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:38,393
Because they will have a wallet which

111
00:04:38,393 --> 00:04:41,073
will be given over at the time of the

112
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,753
vestin being made and then the vested

113
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:46,313
tokens will go to that wallet. So it's

114
00:04:46,313 --> 00:04:48,353
really incentivizing partnerships down

115
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:50,193
the line. We're hoping to get

116
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:52,074
partnerships with the likes of Pump Dot

117
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,914
Fund, for example, so that when a

118
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:55,834
developer does launch a token and it goes

119
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,114
to the bonding curve, there's

120
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:59,154
automatically you know, that the

121
00:04:59,154 --> 00:05:01,994
developer cannot rug you until the

122
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,834
token reaches a certain price. I think

123
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,154
this aligns very well. With

124
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,394
what the community of every

125
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,154
single token wants, they want to have

126
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:13,994
that that Peace of Mind.

127
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:17,714
OK, so let's move on.

128
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:26,364
OK, so we'll discuss what is

129
00:05:26,364 --> 00:05:28,524
Cryptosyvest. Just want to go through

130
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,084
this brief presentation.

131
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,884
We do have place fill up graphics in here

132
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:37,604
which will give us an idea of the

133
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,484
kind of look that we're going to be going

134
00:05:39,484 --> 00:05:42,084
for with the branding for

135
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:45,004
Kryptosi Vest. Of course, this

136
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:46,724
particular series will have maybe about

137
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,884
 10 episodes where we will cover every

138
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,284
single step of the process of developing

139
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,914
this project. So this one. For Sale will

140
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:55,394
be an introduction. Then we're going to

141
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:57,114
cover things like putting a brand

142
00:05:57,114 --> 00:05:59,154
together, putting A-Team together.

143
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:01,874
There'll be an episode for the logic

144
00:06:01,914 --> 00:06:04,674
behind the project, which will go

145
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:07,114
into great detail of how the user

146
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:09,354
experience will be. Will be going to like

147
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:11,874
a step by step of what it will be like to

148
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:14,355
create a new vesting contract or to add

149
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,835
to a new vesting contract, or to withdraw

150
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,875
from a vesting contract at the correct

151
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,475
time, and how to search to see if your

152
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,875
token has a vesting. Tracked,

153
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,955
we're also going to have

154
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,675
episodes for the testing to show the

155
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,155
testing for the wire framing that'll be

156
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,235
enough for episode and for the design

157
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:37,035
will be another episode and we'll have an

158
00:06:37,035 --> 00:06:38,435
episode for the smart contracts.

159
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,805
And the team if I have not already set.

160
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:45,565
So what are the the three main pillars

161
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:48,165
of the cryptos? US, we

162
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:50,365
want everything to be secure, which means

163
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:52,685
that we're going to have to have audited

164
00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:55,365
smart contracts. We will more than

165
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,285
likely use AI auditing as our first

166
00:06:58,285 --> 00:07:01,005
port of call. There are some very good

167
00:07:01,205 --> 00:07:04,195
AI code auditing software. Schools

168
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:06,835
out there now on top of that we will

169
00:07:06,835 --> 00:07:09,435
endeavour to have a proper,

170
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,355
shouldn't say proper, a more

171
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:15,275
full AI, not AI sorry,

172
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:18,515
and more full person LED on human

173
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,715
lead auditing

174
00:07:20,995 --> 00:07:23,315
done by a top auditing firm that will

175
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,435
probably carry that out after we get

176
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,075
funding or grants from one of the EVM

177
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,315
systems. That or EVM networks that we go

178
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,755
with initially Cryptosyfest will be being

179
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:35,475
aimed at the. Networks, so you're looking

180
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,556
at Polygon base BNB,

181
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:40,676
but we do hope to

182
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:43,596
expand to Solana in our

183
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,796
second or third version.

184
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:48,876
And it's important that we start with the

185
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,876
EVMS because we want to start with that

186
00:07:50,876 --> 00:07:53,036
added security and we feel like we could

187
00:07:53,036 --> 00:07:55,556
produce a more secure product if we build

188
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:58,516
it on EVMS initially. Second to

189
00:07:58,516 --> 00:08:00,836
that, we will go for the largest market

190
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:02,596
or the larger market, which will be

191
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:05,036
Solana. And finally, we'll go for the

192
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:07,076
growing markets, which will

193
00:08:07,076 --> 00:08:09,116
be TSUI and Aptos.

194
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,956
So we want secure code, we want

195
00:08:12,276 --> 00:08:15,116
transparent, transparent platforms. So

196
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:16,676
everything will be on the blockchain. All

197
00:08:16,676 --> 00:08:18,356
of the vesting contracts will be on the

198
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:20,316
blockchain. Everything will be totally

199
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:23,196
transparent. You will know how much is

200
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:24,836
being invested. You will know who it is

201
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:27,596
being invested by. You will know who they

202
00:08:27,596 --> 00:08:29,676
plan to pay the vesting out to because

203
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,996
you can FEST tokens and not be the

204
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:33,516
beneficiary of those tokens, you can.

205
00:08:33,716 --> 00:08:36,476
Tokens and then say 1-6 finished, I want

206
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,316
it to go to the Dow or I want it to go to

207
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,356
this particular charity or I want to go

208
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:43,356
to this particular person. So you can

209
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,996
have that type of vest in

210
00:08:46,116 --> 00:08:49,076
and the users will also know

211
00:08:49,076 --> 00:08:51,756
how long it's been invested for and what

212
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:54,716
the actual terms of the release will also

213
00:08:54,716 --> 00:08:56,516
be. So all of those things will be

214
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:59,276
covered in a transparent way by

215
00:08:59,276 --> 00:09:01,557
Cryptosyvest. Finally, we want everything

216
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,527
to be user friendly. Through our Bidify

217
00:09:04,527 --> 00:09:06,887
and Vulcanoid, what we have managed to do

218
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,487
is build amazingly user friendly

219
00:09:09,487 --> 00:09:11,047
products. Products that are.

220
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,797
Very intuitive for people to use and are

221
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,317
not confusing. Currently the

222
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:20,277
scenario is that we know that there are

223
00:09:20,277 --> 00:09:22,517
token lockups, but we don't really know

224
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:25,077
where to go to see these token lockups.

225
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:27,157
And even if we can see them, it's very

226
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:28,917
difficult for the average user to

227
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,037
understand the meaning of these total

228
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,757
lockups. What we may do, which is one of

229
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:36,277
the future goals, if even have.

230
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:39,567
A natural language AI agent plugged

231
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:41,727
into the platform so people could ask it

232
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,527
questions about the.

233
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,487
Vesting contracts that they're looking

234
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:49,407
at. For example they may ask when can

235
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,047
the dev crash the price and how much

236
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:54,367
influence would it have and the AI will

237
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:55,847
look and it will see that the devs only

238
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,727
got a small amount there and the rest

239
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,847
in level is very high. So they say well

240
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:03,127
the dev can't sell until the price

241
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:04,767
reaches very high and with its small

242
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,767
allocation that is vested you probably

243
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,007
won't be able to move the price that

244
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,447
much. Assuming that volumes grow.

245
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,887
So those are the things that we want. One

246
00:10:12,887 --> 00:10:15,567
last thing on security which I failed to

247
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,037
mention is that we will have some. Form

248
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:20,927
of. Anti flash

249
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,288
system. So what we don't want is we don't

250
00:10:24,288 --> 00:10:26,128
want somebody to be able to pump the

251
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:28,368
price within a block and then

252
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,928
withdraw their vested tokens

253
00:10:31,928 --> 00:10:34,488
and thus rub pool the people

254
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,528
you can. This

255
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:39,248
slightly beyond the scope of this video

256
00:10:39,248 --> 00:10:41,688
actually, but I'll go into it. You can

257
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,328
flash loan, borrow money for one block

258
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:47,128
and move the price of something and then.

259
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:50,038
Give that money back within that same

260
00:10:50,038 --> 00:10:52,998
block. We definitely do not want that

261
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:55,798
to happen. So we will be looking into how

262
00:10:55,798 --> 00:10:58,038
viable that is as a

263
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:01,438
vulnerability. It may not be that liable

264
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:03,118
and we will be making.

265
00:11:04,808 --> 00:11:07,608
Every effort to mitigate that. So

266
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:11,288
let's move on. OK, so

267
00:11:11,288 --> 00:11:13,928
we discussed the key, the

268
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:16,368
key advantages to Kurtosi Vest.

269
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:21,248
We've got some very early stage mockups

270
00:11:21,248 --> 00:11:23,608
of what we think the dashboard will look

271
00:11:23,608 --> 00:11:26,488
like. We

272
00:11:26,488 --> 00:11:29,168
also. Want

273
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:31,848
to I guess highlight the multi chain

274
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,128
compatibility. So this

275
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,368
platform like the Crypto C,

276
00:11:37,888 --> 00:11:40,088
like a bit of fire already has, will

277
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:42,688
cover quite a lot of Evms. We're planning

278
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:45,328
to have one or two at launch and

279
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,089
maybe about a month later.

280
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,679
9 or 10 and we want to go for the ones

281
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,799
with the biggest volume and try to help

282
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,199
them build out their own. It will

283
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:57,799
initially be I guess mean coin.

284
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:02,809
Sectors, but as mean coin

285
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:05,329
tokenomics are becoming more popular in

286
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:07,249
other projects, AI agents or things like

287
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,049
that, which aren't mean quads, that token

288
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:11,849
Onix or that token on the structure where

289
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,969
you have 1 billion tokens and you have

290
00:12:13,969 --> 00:12:16,329
different entities receiving them at

291
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:19,079
launch. That structure needs itself

292
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,279
very well to also be used with

293
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,159
cryptosyvest.

294
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:27,489
The project is community driven, so

295
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,729
hopefully it will be built with funding

296
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:32,009
from Kurtosidou. I can't say it will be

297
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,169
for sure now because we haven't actually

298
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:35,809
put the proposal in at the time of making

299
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:38,489
this video, as this video will be a part

300
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:39,489
of the proposal.

301
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:43,809
And real time tracking as I already spoke

302
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,489
about. So what is the need for

303
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:48,009
Cryptosyvest? As we all know, developers

304
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,919
are rugging contracts. And

305
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,599
projects left, right and centre.

306
00:12:54,569 --> 00:12:56,449
Often you will know, or some people will

307
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,169
know that they're going to get rugged and

308
00:12:58,169 --> 00:12:59,769
they just buy anyway and hope that they

309
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:02,369
can jump out before the developer does.

310
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:05,169
Sometimes I guess they win, sometimes

311
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:07,049
they don't have in.

312
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,120
A absolute knowledge that the

313
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,480
developer cannot rug with this particular

314
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,320
amount of his coins is or

315
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,1000
tokens is a huge advantage

316
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
for the user and I think it's something

317
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,760
that developers will also want to

318
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,640
leverage. We have to discuss a

319
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,040
caveat, which will be that just

320
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,840
because the developer labels this

321
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,440
as a developer wallet or that was the

322
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,360
wallet that created the token, it doesn't

323
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,080
mean that developer or a cabal around

324
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,880
him. Not own other tokens in other

325
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,800
places, in other wallets that he has not

326
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,520
rested. So this does not make everything

327
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,920
absolutely foolproof. It is just yet

328
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,160
enough a signal or another tool that

329
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,080
people can use both to ensure trust,

330
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,920
inspire trust from both ways.

331
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,720
So for the community members to get trust

332
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,920
on their developer and for the developer

333
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,080
to inspire trust in themselves, there are

334
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,490
tools like bubble maps. Which

335
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,730
will help you to.

336
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,280
See or identify if

337
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,840
other entities have got clusters of large

338
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,800
tokens and I guess we will cover

339
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,520
that in a a

340
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,640
later episode and hopefully we can get a

341
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,160
partnership with them as well. We will

342
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
definitely try.

343
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,480
Also, another reason that we need it is

344
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
that there isn't a robust and user

345
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,801
friendly platform for vesting, so it

346
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,321
really needs to be done. It's a part of

347
00:14:37,321 --> 00:14:39,001
the inner structure that doesn't quite

348
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,721
yet exist and especially

349
00:14:41,721 --> 00:14:44,481
hasn't been incentivized. OK,

350
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:47,081
so who are the builders? I am Fritosi, I

351
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,281
am the project manager I

352
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,171
guess and. I

353
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:55,371
can't claim the idea for myself because

354
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,331
it's an idea that has existed. I've we've

355
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:01,321
just. Found some ways to improve upon

356
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:04,041
the idea. Currently the developer who

357
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,481
we will be tasking with building this

358
00:15:06,481 --> 00:15:09,441
will be a Snowman or Bino as he's

359
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,841
also known. He was one of the

360
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:14,801
developers in Bitter 5 in its early

361
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,481
stages. So although he did not develop

362
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:20,321
the smart contracts behind Bidify, he did

363
00:15:20,321 --> 00:15:23,161
improve them. He added a buy it

364
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,131
now system. And

365
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,331
he added, he's added quite a few things,

366
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:30,451
but we do have a Meet the developer Park

367
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,251
video on this channel with Snowman

368
00:15:33,251 --> 00:15:35,811
or Bino. So I will put a link to that in

369
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,811
the description or you can just search

370
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,171
the channel, Smartreach channel and you

371
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,881
will find it. Biden has got a a

372
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,601
long history of working with us. He's

373
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:47,961
worked with us on quite a few things. So

374
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,961
we're quite sure he will be able

375
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:52,441
to pull this one off.

376
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:56,442
And if he can't, we have other developers

377
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,482
in the wings waiting to pick up where he

378
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,282
left off. But we're confident he can

379
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:03,202
build it. Early suggestions say

380
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:05,562
that the development of the

381
00:16:05,562 --> 00:16:08,292
platform. Altogether will take possibly

382
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,212
around two months, so we should be

383
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:14,092
able to finish it in three

384
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:16,572
good sprints. I would say each Sprint.

385
00:16:16,882 --> 00:16:19,202
Maybe last in two weeks.

386
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:22,482
So we should be able to to do that.

387
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,962
I think that's it with Barno.

388
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:30,242
Sorry. Let's move on. OK, so what's our

389
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:31,642
path to success? So this is a very

390
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:34,322
loosely written

391
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:35,322
road map.

392
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,692
So we plan to launch Q

393
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,652
 12025. We want to be integrated

394
00:16:41,652 --> 00:16:43,492
with the lead the the leading blockchain

395
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,812
networks, the top EVM chains.

396
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,452
We really want to be with Solana as well,

397
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,052
but it's a completely different

398
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:54,412
technology. Solana is to a complete

399
00:16:54,412 --> 00:16:56,772
different technology to the EVM so.

400
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,402
We can't as easily port from

401
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:03,722
EVM to Solana as we can from EVM

402
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,442
to another EVM. So we will start with the

403
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,362
EVM as overall it's possibly

404
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,842
slightly more market share

405
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,842
expansion or functional features,

406
00:17:13,842 --> 00:17:16,082
features or functionality. At the end of

407
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,642
this show, I will speak briefly

408
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:21,403
to what features our

409
00:17:21,403 --> 00:17:24,123
functionality we are planning to add in

410
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:26,213
the future. Partnerships with top

411
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,163
blockchain projects. We will be working

412
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:31,883
on that as soon as possible. This video

413
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,323
will also serve as.

414
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:37,653
A call to action for grant

415
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:39,813
teams and.

416
00:17:41,813 --> 00:17:44,733
Other such funding methods which we will

417
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:47,133
be applying for on the top ten

418
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,653
Evms that we are planning to build on.

419
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:52,413
So if we do get those grants or that

420
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:55,293
funding, what it also hopefully will

421
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:57,893
do is it will lead us to get connections

422
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,653
to the other top projects on those

423
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,843
networks. Which will

424
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:05,043
enhance our ability to get

425
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:05,683
partnerships.

426
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,573
Finally, we want to have continued

427
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:13,493
development and innovation similar

428
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,413
to Bidify and Vulcan Launchpad once it's

429
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:18,573
built. That's only the beginning. The

430
00:18:18,573 --> 00:18:21,333
plan is to keep it ahead of the game, to

431
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,573
keep it up to date with the

432
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:26,373
the growing, I

433
00:18:26,413 --> 00:18:28,973
guess, philosophies and

434
00:18:29,013 --> 00:18:31,733
ethos and functionality.

435
00:18:32,643 --> 00:18:34,843
Behind crypto. So

436
00:18:35,603 --> 00:18:37,803
that's how a new state based road map. Of

437
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:40,443
course the road maps are always

438
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:43,244
fluent and I expect this road map

439
00:18:43,244 --> 00:18:45,484
to become more fleshed out over time

440
00:18:45,644 --> 00:18:48,524
with time scales of when we plan to do

441
00:18:48,524 --> 00:18:51,124
these things. But now is a little bit too

442
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:54,004
early to say, OK, so how

443
00:18:54,004 --> 00:18:55,844
are we going to ensure trust and safety?

444
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,164
We touched on it before, so I'll keep it

445
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:01,084
brief. We want auditable smart contracts.

446
00:19:02,014 --> 00:19:04,054
Auditable and verified, that's.

447
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,314
I want the beauties of the EVM. You'll be

448
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:09,714
able to see what exactly is you are

449
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:12,234
working with and you can audit those

450
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,074
contracts yourself if you want to, but

451
00:19:15,074 --> 00:19:17,794
we will audit them too. Anti

452
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:20,714
flash mechanisms, how those will work at

453
00:19:21,434 --> 00:19:24,034
the moment is that the price will need to

454
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:25,674
remain above a certain level for a

455
00:19:25,674 --> 00:19:27,594
certain length of time, so.

456
00:19:29,454 --> 00:19:31,894
We're thinking somewhere between 24

457
00:19:31,894 --> 00:19:34,734
hours to one week should be

458
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,494
around the time that price should stay

459
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:39,404
above a level before. Release is

460
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,404
eligible and people can activate it. Once

461
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:45,964
you activate release, which should be be

462
00:19:45,964 --> 00:19:48,764
which should be possible from any wallet.

463
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:50,084
So it's not only the people who are old

464
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:51,564
tokens that can activate the release. It

465
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:53,564
should be anybody that can activate the

466
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:56,524
release of these tokens. And we

467
00:19:56,524 --> 00:19:58,044
will have regular audits. The reason why

468
00:19:58,044 --> 00:19:59,284
we'll have regular audits is because

469
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:00,564
we'll be having regular updates to the

470
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:02,844
code base. Every time you have an update,

471
00:20:02,844 --> 00:20:04,484
you potentially introduce new

472
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:06,445
vulnerabilities. Also, there are new

473
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:07,965
vulnerabilities being found every day.

474
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:11,525
So we will need to have regular audits.

475
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:13,765
By regular I mean.

476
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,925
Every six to 12 months, assuming there

477
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:21,845
are no changes to

478
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,485
the code base. Otherwise, anytime we make

479
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,925
relevant or sizable changes to the code

480
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:29,165
base, we should have another audit.

481
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:33,285
OK. And that is it. So yeah,

482
00:20:33,285 --> 00:20:36,085
join us in revolutionising the blockchain

483
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:39,125
and just making vesting

484
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:40,445
a more.

485
00:20:42,165 --> 00:20:45,125
Accessible and useful tool

486
00:20:45,685 --> 00:20:48,645
for everybody involved. What

487
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:51,245
I want to do, briefly is take you behind

488
00:20:51,245 --> 00:20:52,845
the scenes. So here's our.

489
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,735
Working Document. This is a document that

490
00:20:56,735 --> 00:20:58,735
we work within as a team.

491
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,925
We touch on, so we've got all of our

492
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:04,405
dolls lined up just so that we're all on

493
00:21:04,405 --> 00:21:06,605
the same page. We've got all of our goals

494
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:08,565
lined up and the things that are the most

495
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,285
important. Oh, one thing I did touch on

496
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,685
was the escape hatch, which will

497
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:15,085
allow cryptosy Dow

498
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:18,125
members to remove the whole

499
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,405
funds of any particular.

500
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,135
Investing contract should that contract

501
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:27,735
for whatever reason no longer be fit for

502
00:21:27,735 --> 00:21:29,936
purpose? So if a developer

503
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,376
accidentally says I want my token to

504
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:35,246
reach. trillion, when

505
00:21:35,246 --> 00:21:36,806
really they meant I wanted to reach 1

506
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:39,326
billion. Then we should be able to

507
00:21:40,486 --> 00:21:43,046
remove those funds to the

508
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,726
cryptosyde out, and then from there send

509
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:48,686
them to whoever needs them. That

510
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:51,606
will come with a lot of bureaucracy. So

511
00:21:51,606 --> 00:21:53,566
chances are if you're a small project and

512
00:21:53,566 --> 00:21:55,286
you've made that mistake, it's going to

513
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:58,126
be too bad, too sad. But that is one of

514
00:21:58,126 --> 00:21:59,686
the things that happens within blockchain

515
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,216
anyway. We had the Dow. We've had things

516
00:22:02,216 --> 00:22:04,886
like that we've had. Accidental lockups

517
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:07,766
like we did on, I want to say parity.

518
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:11,006
Umm. And I've done it myself,

519
00:22:11,006 --> 00:22:13,046
so it does happen where you do lock

520
00:22:13,046 --> 00:22:15,046
things up. You got to take your time. If

521
00:22:15,046 --> 00:22:16,846
you don't, we do have an escape hatch,

522
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:19,246
which will be like a worst case scenario

523
00:22:19,246 --> 00:22:22,136
system. That

524
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:24,896
does obviously introduce its own issues,

525
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:27,696
so the deployment of

526
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:30,456
this escape hatch will be I guess.

527
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:34,336
Possibly optional. So possibly if you

528
00:22:34,336 --> 00:22:35,976
don't want to have the escape hatch, you

529
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:38,136
could possibly set up your existing

530
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:40,176
contract without it being there and then.

531
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,926
If you do it wrong or something gets

532
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:44,406
locked in that testing contract, then

533
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,286
you're on your own. So I think that makes

534
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:46,806
sense actually.

535
00:22:48,376 --> 00:22:50,736
Specification, vesting schedules, price

536
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:53,177
base, audited smart contracts,

537
00:22:53,697 --> 00:22:56,097
we discussed the the fees

538
00:22:57,017 --> 00:22:59,737
already and our milestones. We

539
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:02,297
also discussed I think maybe this Q

540
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,977
3 might be moved forward to Q2,

541
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:07,417
possibly even Q1 if we can, if we can

542
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:10,617
ship it in time. And then we have our our

543
00:23:10,617 --> 00:23:13,297
steps that will that will go through

544
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:16,017
each step will be another episode. So

545
00:23:16,017 --> 00:23:18,397
create a team and the brand. Create a

546
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,957
logic document, create a wireframes,

547
00:23:21,037 --> 00:23:23,597
create a front end, design

548
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,557
smart contracts, back end, integrate,

549
00:23:25,557 --> 00:23:28,317
fully testing, launch and finally future

550
00:23:28,317 --> 00:23:31,077
features NFT beneficiaries.

551
00:23:33,727 --> 00:23:36,487
Instead of just your wallet being

552
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:38,887
thing, you want it being tracked

553
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:41,807
by the smart pun tracks

554
00:23:41,807 --> 00:23:44,207
that have the resting tokens. You may get

555
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:45,767
an NFT. What that will mean is that you

556
00:23:45,767 --> 00:23:48,757
can trade your vested token so. I may

557
00:23:48,757 --> 00:23:51,317
have 1,000,000 vested

558
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:53,837
cryptosy coins that I can only release

559
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:56,117
when it reaches $1.00, but I may be able

560
00:23:56,117 --> 00:23:58,677
to sell that share for $100

561
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:02,157
 tosomebody who believes that

562
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,037
we will reach that price more than I

563
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:06,957
believe I reach that price. So that

564
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,277
secondary market would be extremely

565
00:24:09,277 --> 00:24:11,157
interesting. So we are considering a

566
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,397
building around that it it will also

567
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,798
possibly provide another income source if

568
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:18,448
there is. A Some sort of tax

569
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:21,518
on the. Selling of

570
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,278
the NFTS from one person to another.

571
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,808
AI support I touched on monitor alerts

572
00:24:28,448 --> 00:24:31,368
would also be useful. So you may get a

573
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:33,048
text message or a Telegram message or an

574
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:35,608
 e-mail to say that your

575
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:37,808
token is near its resting target.

576
00:24:38,608 --> 00:24:40,368
It would be a lovely thing, like a

577
00:24:40,368 --> 00:24:43,328
celebration time. I'm about to be able

578
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,128
to release some of my tokens. Vested

579
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,968
liquidity will be, I guess, where

580
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:51,128
we take the vested tokens.

581
00:24:51,638 --> 00:24:53,478
And we put them into.

582
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:57,958
Liquidity pool and we then have the

583
00:24:57,958 --> 00:24:59,438
rewards from that liquidity pool be

584
00:24:59,438 --> 00:25:00,918
shared amongst all the people who have

585
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:02,838
vested tokens, which would incentivise

586
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:04,758
your community to come vest with you

587
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:06,638
because they will then benefit from the

588
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:08,798
trading fees as well as

589
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,638
strengthening the tokenomics of their

590
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:14,118
project. And then

591
00:25:14,118 --> 00:25:16,758
finally a faith-based

592
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:19,278
audit. It's important

593
00:25:19,758 --> 00:25:22,318
that we build something that uses

594
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:25,198
worldwide can get involved in. Which

595
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:27,678
means it has to adhere to their

596
00:25:28,198 --> 00:25:30,958
their view of the world. And we have had

597
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:33,598
some projects which we have decided not

598
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,528
to build which. Impinge on

599
00:25:36,528 --> 00:25:39,169
certain people's faiths. So we're going

600
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,489
to audit that. Not to say that if it

601
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:43,369
doesn't align with a certain person's

602
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:45,609
faith that we won't build it, but just

603
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:48,569
that we're on top of that and we

604
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:50,809
make sure that our users are also on top

605
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:53,369
of that. So we can say this is

606
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:56,249
OK for you to use as there are.

607
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,799
Not

608
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,199
overwhelmingly high interest

609
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:04,559
being earned or usury or any of these

610
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,839
other sorts of things that can turn up in

611
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,639
this minefield of a world we have

612
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:11,519
now where people from all over the world

613
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,119
are expected to use the same tools. So

614
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:15,639
I've been crypto. See, this has been your

615
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,079
introduction to Cryptosyvest.

616
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,679
I hope you have understood exactly what

617
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,329
it is we are planning to do. To put it

618
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:26,769
into a nutshell, in case you haven't, is.

619
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:30,559
Develop underwater token. Developer

620
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,519
locks up a certain amount of token.

621
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,879
Developer can only take the token back

622
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,839
when the project reaches a certain price.

623
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,799
Developer then is super incentivized for

624
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,159
the token to reach a certain price and he

625
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,039
cannot take his ball and leave. He can

626
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,559
leave if he wants to, but if he does, he

627
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:48,999
is leaving that

628
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:51,679
reward in the.

629
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:56,409
In the vesting project, if the project

630
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,569
dies, his portion of it dies with it.

631
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,200
When we have NFTS, the developer will

632
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
get an NFT, which makes the community

633
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,040
take over of any type much

634
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,880
more viable. The developer

635
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,320
can then give the NFT to whoever decides

636
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,200
to take over a project, and if they trust

637
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,920
that developer not hiding another massive

638
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,640
amount of tokens elsewhere, which they

639
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,920
can verify to a degree by using bubble

640
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,330
maps, they can at least mitigate it. Then

641
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,050
they may buy the dev rights off of

642
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:31,040
that guy and get the NFT. And then when I

643
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,840
had to reach a certain light, then this

644
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
new death can claim his

645
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,120
rewards. That is, in a nutshell,

646
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,720
what Cryptosy Rest will be doing. We are

647
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
going to be building this regardless. So

648
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,520
if you're watching this video because of

649
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,680
a grant and you're considering whether or

650
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,600
not to allow the

651
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,570
grant. We're

652
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,930
kind of oxygen out of courtesy. We're

653
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,850
already building on networks where we are

654
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,650
free to build anyway, so we are going to

655
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,520
deploy on the network anyway. Regardless

656
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,440
of whether or not you offer the grant, of

657
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,960
course the grant will be nice. It will

658
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,320
help us to add bells and whistles. We can

659
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,080
pay for marketing or we can pay to

660
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,920
have business developers reach out to

661
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,480
other projects within that ecosystem.

662
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,640
And also it's, it's more of a

663
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
sign that you want us on the

664
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,120
network, you want this product on the

665
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,000
network and we go

666
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,851
to where we are loved. As

667
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:28,971
humans, we just do so.

668
00:28:29,881 --> 00:28:32,441
I've been crypto see you have been

669
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:34,721
beautiful and hopefully

670
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:37,161
I will see you in the next episode where

671
00:28:37,361 --> 00:28:40,161
we will discuss the brand

672
00:28:40,561 --> 00:28:43,441
and everything around that, which at

673
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,921
this moment of time is actually complete.

674
00:28:46,241 --> 00:28:48,961
And I think we can

675
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,721
see the logo up here just as a

676
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:54,681
here's one we produced earlier. And

677
00:28:54,681 --> 00:28:57,481
this is going to be the the look

678
00:28:57,721 --> 00:28:59,721
of the site or the look of the brand.

679
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:03,521
So facts watching and I will see

680
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:05,681
you in the next one please.
