Hello and welcome to this short

video, which will be an introduction to

one of the most exciting and

important projects of

2025. This, ladies and

gentlemen, is Crypto C

Vest.

OK, I'm Cryptosy. I have

developed and built

platforms such as Bidify and Vulcan

Launchpad. I am one of the

first members of the Cryptosy

Dow which fingers crossed will be

funding a portion of the development

of this project as it will be receiving a

portion of the fees for this project

but. What is the project, why does it

exist, and how we're going to build it?So

first of all, Kryptosi Vest will

be a customizable vesting

platform. The idea being that you

allow developers, or anyone really,

to vest their tokens and

have them released at varying

times and over

varying schedules now.

This is not anything that is new.

However, the way we're going to be doing

it is going to be unique. So the USPS,

the unique selling points for this

particular platform. Will be twofold.

First of all, we will have a price

triggering mechanism. This means that

devs can put their portion

of the supply into cryptosy vest

and it will not be released until the

project reaches a certain milestone.

The reason behind this thinking behind

this is that it will incentivize the

developers to get the price of

their particular token up to a certain.

Value before they can realise any of the

benefits. It means they will be working

for the community until such a point as

they have achieved their job for the

community, which will be getting their

hope into a particular price. Of course,

there is some game theory here which does

say that when they get it to that price,

what's to say that they won't just dump

it immediately? So will people. Or will

we always be selling just below that

price? Of course you can always.

Well not of course, but you will be able

to move your tokens

with invested project to. Higher

price, but you will not be able to move

them to a lower price. So what we

probably will see happen, as we haven't

seen that unfold yet, is we may see

developers move a small portion of their

or a big portion of their holdings at a

certain price up to another price

before their prices hit.

This will give the community the.

The knowledge that the developer is

still evolved and he's still

incentivizing himself. To keep on pushing

higher and higher, the second unique

selling point of Cryptosyfest will be the

fee structure. What we're going to do is

we're going to have currently, so this

this may be subject to change, but

currently we're looking to have a 5%

fee, which will be a flat fee

for all vested and will not be paid out

until such a time as the token has

reached its price target. Or is

being released if it's just a regular

linear or Cliff scheduling so

it won't only be price. You can have lock

up my tokens for six months or 12 months.

And then release them one month at a time

like regular schedule. It that's the

case, the fees don't get released until

the tokens are being released. The

fee structure will have

two components to it. There will be a

2.5% flat fee which

goes only.

To the cryptosy down. I'm not quite sure

what that special effect was just there

behind me, but there will be a 2.5%

fee which goes only to the cryptosyll

that will fund further developments by

the crypto sidel maintenance

for the. Bidify

platform for Vulcan, Launchpad for

Cryptosyves, for all of those things

moving forward. And there will also be a

2.5% fee which

is given to the vestin

partner, which means every

time a developer decides the vest, if he

does it through a vesting partners

website, that website will be

eligible to claim. Their

2.5% of the rested tokens upon

their release at the release time.

Because they will have a wallet which

will be given over at the time of the

vestin being made and then the vested

tokens will go to that wallet. So it's

really incentivizing partnerships down

the line. We're hoping to get

partnerships with the likes of Pump Dot

Fund, for example, so that when a

developer does launch a token and it goes

to the bonding curve, there's

automatically you know, that the

developer cannot rug you until the

token reaches a certain price. I think

this aligns very well. With

what the community of every

single token wants, they want to have

that that Peace of Mind.

OK, so let's move on.

OK, so we'll discuss what is

Cryptosyvest. Just want to go through

this brief presentation.

We do have place fill up graphics in here

which will give us an idea of the

kind of look that we're going to be going

for with the branding for

Kryptosi Vest. Of course, this

particular series will have maybe about

10 episodes where we will cover every

single step of the process of developing

this project. So this one. For Sale will

be an introduction. Then we're going to

cover things like putting a brand

together, putting A-Team together.

There'll be an episode for the logic

behind the project, which will go

into great detail of how the user

experience will be. Will be going to like

a step by step of what it will be like to

create a new vesting contract or to add

to a new vesting contract, or to withdraw

from a vesting contract at the correct

time, and how to search to see if your

token has a vesting. Tracked,

we're also going to have

episodes for the testing to show the

testing for the wire framing that'll be

enough for episode and for the design

will be another episode and we'll have an

episode for the smart contracts.

And the team if I have not already set.

So what are the the three main pillars

of the cryptos? US, we

want everything to be secure, which means

that we're going to have to have audited

smart contracts. We will more than

likely use AI auditing as our first

port of call. There are some very good

AI code auditing software. Schools

out there now on top of that we will

endeavour to have a proper,

shouldn't say proper, a more

full AI, not AI sorry,

and more full person LED on human

lead auditing

done by a top auditing firm that will

probably carry that out after we get

funding or grants from one of the EVM

systems. That or EVM networks that we go

with initially Cryptosyfest will be being

aimed at the. Networks, so you're looking

at Polygon base BNB,

but we do hope to

expand to Solana in our

second or third version.

And it's important that we start with the

EVMS because we want to start with that

added security and we feel like we could

produce a more secure product if we build

it on EVMS initially. Second to

that, we will go for the largest market

or the larger market, which will be

Solana. And finally, we'll go for the

growing markets, which will

be TSUI and Aptos.

So we want secure code, we want

transparent, transparent platforms. So

everything will be on the blockchain. All

of the vesting contracts will be on the

blockchain. Everything will be totally

transparent. You will know how much is

being invested. You will know who it is

being invested by. You will know who they

plan to pay the vesting out to because

you can FEST tokens and not be the

beneficiary of those tokens, you can.

Tokens and then say 1-6 finished, I want

it to go to the Dow or I want it to go to

this particular charity or I want to go

to this particular person. So you can

have that type of vest in

and the users will also know

how long it's been invested for and what

the actual terms of the release will also

be. So all of those things will be

covered in a transparent way by

Cryptosyvest. Finally, we want everything

to be user friendly. Through our Bidify

and Vulcanoid, what we have managed to do

is build amazingly user friendly

products. Products that are.

Very intuitive for people to use and are

not confusing. Currently the

scenario is that we know that there are

token lockups, but we don't really know

where to go to see these token lockups.

And even if we can see them, it's very

difficult for the average user to

understand the meaning of these total

lockups. What we may do, which is one of

the future goals, if even have.

A natural language AI agent plugged

into the platform so people could ask it

questions about the.

Vesting contracts that they're looking

at. For example they may ask when can

the dev crash the price and how much

influence would it have and the AI will

look and it will see that the devs only

got a small amount there and the rest

in level is very high. So they say well

the dev can't sell until the price

reaches very high and with its small

allocation that is vested you probably

won't be able to move the price that

much. Assuming that volumes grow.

So those are the things that we want. One

last thing on security which I failed to

mention is that we will have some. Form

of. Anti flash

system. So what we don't want is we don't

want somebody to be able to pump the

price within a block and then

withdraw their vested tokens

and thus rub pool the people

you can. This

slightly beyond the scope of this video

actually, but I'll go into it. You can

flash loan, borrow money for one block

and move the price of something and then.

Give that money back within that same

block. We definitely do not want that

to happen. So we will be looking into how

viable that is as a

vulnerability. It may not be that liable

and we will be making.

Every effort to mitigate that. So

let's move on. OK, so

we discussed the key, the

key advantages to Kurtosi Vest.

We've got some very early stage mockups

of what we think the dashboard will look

like. We

also. Want

to I guess highlight the multi chain

compatibility. So this

platform like the Crypto C,

like a bit of fire already has, will

cover quite a lot of Evms. We're planning

to have one or two at launch and

maybe about a month later.

9 or 10 and we want to go for the ones

with the biggest volume and try to help

them build out their own. It will

initially be I guess mean coin.

Sectors, but as mean coin

tokenomics are becoming more popular in

other projects, AI agents or things like

that, which aren't mean quads, that token

Onix or that token on the structure where

you have 1 billion tokens and you have

different entities receiving them at

launch. That structure needs itself

very well to also be used with

cryptosyvest.

The project is community driven, so

hopefully it will be built with funding

from Kurtosidou. I can't say it will be

for sure now because we haven't actually

put the proposal in at the time of making

this video, as this video will be a part

of the proposal.

And real time tracking as I already spoke

about. So what is the need for

Cryptosyvest? As we all know, developers

are rugging contracts. And

projects left, right and centre.

Often you will know, or some people will

know that they're going to get rugged and

they just buy anyway and hope that they

can jump out before the developer does.

Sometimes I guess they win, sometimes

they don't have in.

A absolute knowledge that the

developer cannot rug with this particular

amount of his coins is or

tokens is a huge advantage

for the user and I think it's something

that developers will also want to

leverage. We have to discuss a

caveat, which will be that just

because the developer labels this

as a developer wallet or that was the

wallet that created the token, it doesn't

mean that developer or a cabal around

him. Not own other tokens in other

places, in other wallets that he has not

rested. So this does not make everything

absolutely foolproof. It is just yet

enough a signal or another tool that

people can use both to ensure trust,

inspire trust from both ways.

So for the community members to get trust

on their developer and for the developer

to inspire trust in themselves, there are

tools like bubble maps. Which

will help you to.

See or identify if

other entities have got clusters of large

tokens and I guess we will cover

that in a a

later episode and hopefully we can get a

partnership with them as well. We will

definitely try.

Also, another reason that we need it is

that there isn't a robust and user

friendly platform for vesting, so it

really needs to be done. It's a part of

the inner structure that doesn't quite

yet exist and especially

hasn't been incentivized. OK,

so who are the builders? I am Fritosi, I

am the project manager I

guess and. I

can't claim the idea for myself because

it's an idea that has existed. I've we've

just. Found some ways to improve upon

the idea. Currently the developer who

we will be tasking with building this

will be a Snowman or Bino as he's

also known. He was one of the

developers in Bitter 5 in its early

stages. So although he did not develop

the smart contracts behind Bidify, he did

improve them. He added a buy it

now system. And

he added, he's added quite a few things,

but we do have a Meet the developer Park

video on this channel with Snowman

or Bino. So I will put a link to that in

the description or you can just search

the channel, Smartreach channel and you

will find it. Biden has got a a

long history of working with us. He's

worked with us on quite a few things. So

we're quite sure he will be able

to pull this one off.

And if he can't, we have other developers

in the wings waiting to pick up where he

left off. But we're confident he can

build it. Early suggestions say

that the development of the

platform. Altogether will take possibly

around two months, so we should be

able to finish it in three

good sprints. I would say each Sprint.

Maybe last in two weeks.

So we should be able to to do that.

I think that's it with Barno.

Sorry. Let's move on. OK, so what's our

path to success? So this is a very

loosely written

road map.

So we plan to launch Q

12025. We want to be integrated

with the lead the the leading blockchain

networks, the top EVM chains.

We really want to be with Solana as well,

but it's a completely different

technology. Solana is to a complete

different technology to the EVM so.

We can't as easily port from

EVM to Solana as we can from EVM

to another EVM. So we will start with the

EVM as overall it's possibly

slightly more market share

expansion or functional features,

features or functionality. At the end of

this show, I will speak briefly

to what features our

functionality we are planning to add in

the future. Partnerships with top

blockchain projects. We will be working

on that as soon as possible. This video

will also serve as.

A call to action for grant

teams and.

Other such funding methods which we will

be applying for on the top ten

Evms that we are planning to build on.

So if we do get those grants or that

funding, what it also hopefully will

do is it will lead us to get connections

to the other top projects on those

networks. Which will

enhance our ability to get

partnerships.

Finally, we want to have continued

development and innovation similar

to Bidify and Vulcan Launchpad once it's

built. That's only the beginning. The

plan is to keep it ahead of the game, to

keep it up to date with the

the growing, I

guess, philosophies and

ethos and functionality.

Behind crypto. So

that's how a new state based road map. Of

course the road maps are always

fluent and I expect this road map

to become more fleshed out over time

with time scales of when we plan to do

these things. But now is a little bit too

early to say, OK, so how

are we going to ensure trust and safety?

We touched on it before, so I'll keep it

brief. We want auditable smart contracts.

Auditable and verified, that's.

I want the beauties of the EVM. You'll be

able to see what exactly is you are

working with and you can audit those

contracts yourself if you want to, but

we will audit them too. Anti

flash mechanisms, how those will work at

the moment is that the price will need to

remain above a certain level for a

certain length of time, so.

We're thinking somewhere between 24

hours to one week should be

around the time that price should stay

above a level before. Release is

eligible and people can activate it. Once

you activate release, which should be be

which should be possible from any wallet.

So it's not only the people who are old

tokens that can activate the release. It

should be anybody that can activate the

release of these tokens. And we

will have regular audits. The reason why

we'll have regular audits is because

we'll be having regular updates to the

code base. Every time you have an update,

you potentially introduce new

vulnerabilities. Also, there are new

vulnerabilities being found every day.

So we will need to have regular audits.

By regular I mean.

Every six to 12 months, assuming there

are no changes to

the code base. Otherwise, anytime we make

relevant or sizable changes to the code

base, we should have another audit.

OK. And that is it. So yeah,

join us in revolutionising the blockchain

and just making vesting

a more.

Accessible and useful tool

for everybody involved. What

I want to do, briefly is take you behind

the scenes. So here's our.

Working Document. This is a document that

we work within as a team.

We touch on, so we've got all of our

dolls lined up just so that we're all on

the same page. We've got all of our goals

lined up and the things that are the most

important. Oh, one thing I did touch on

was the escape hatch, which will

allow cryptosy Dow

members to remove the whole

funds of any particular.

Investing contract should that contract

for whatever reason no longer be fit for

purpose? So if a developer

accidentally says I want my token to

reach. trillion, when

really they meant I wanted to reach 1

billion. Then we should be able to

remove those funds to the

cryptosyde out, and then from there send

them to whoever needs them. That

will come with a lot of bureaucracy. So

chances are if you're a small project and

you've made that mistake, it's going to

be too bad, too sad. But that is one of

the things that happens within blockchain

anyway. We had the Dow. We've had things

like that we've had. Accidental lockups

like we did on, I want to say parity.

Umm. And I've done it myself,

so it does happen where you do lock

things up. You got to take your time. If

you don't, we do have an escape hatch,

which will be like a worst case scenario

system. That

does obviously introduce its own issues,

so the deployment of

this escape hatch will be I guess.

Possibly optional. So possibly if you

don't want to have the escape hatch, you

could possibly set up your existing

contract without it being there and then.

If you do it wrong or something gets

locked in that testing contract, then

you're on your own. So I think that makes

sense actually.

Specification, vesting schedules, price

base, audited smart contracts,

we discussed the the fees

already and our milestones. We

also discussed I think maybe this Q

3 might be moved forward to Q2,

possibly even Q1 if we can, if we can

ship it in time. And then we have our our

steps that will that will go through

each step will be another episode. So

create a team and the brand. Create a

logic document, create a wireframes,

create a front end, design

smart contracts, back end, integrate,

fully testing, launch and finally future

features NFT beneficiaries.

Instead of just your wallet being

thing, you want it being tracked

by the smart pun tracks

that have the resting tokens. You may get

an NFT. What that will mean is that you

can trade your vested token so. I may

have 1,000,000 vested

cryptosy coins that I can only release

when it reaches $1.00, but I may be able

to sell that share for $100

tosomebody who believes that

we will reach that price more than I

believe I reach that price. So that

secondary market would be extremely

interesting. So we are considering a

building around that it it will also

possibly provide another income source if

there is. A Some sort of tax

on the. Selling of

the NFTS from one person to another.

AI support I touched on monitor alerts

would also be useful. So you may get a

text message or a Telegram message or an

e-mail to say that your

token is near its resting target.

It would be a lovely thing, like a

celebration time. I'm about to be able

to release some of my tokens. Vested

liquidity will be, I guess, where

we take the vested tokens.

And we put them into.

Liquidity pool and we then have the

rewards from that liquidity pool be

shared amongst all the people who have

vested tokens, which would incentivise

your community to come vest with you

because they will then benefit from the

trading fees as well as

strengthening the tokenomics of their

project. And then

finally a faith-based

audit. It's important

that we build something that uses

worldwide can get involved in. Which

means it has to adhere to their

their view of the world. And we have had

some projects which we have decided not

to build which. Impinge on

certain people's faiths. So we're going

to audit that. Not to say that if it

doesn't align with a certain person's

faith that we won't build it, but just

that we're on top of that and we

make sure that our users are also on top

of that. So we can say this is

OK for you to use as there are.

Not

overwhelmingly high interest

being earned or usury or any of these

other sorts of things that can turn up in

this minefield of a world we have

now where people from all over the world

are expected to use the same tools. So

I've been crypto. See, this has been your

introduction to Cryptosyvest.

I hope you have understood exactly what

it is we are planning to do. To put it

into a nutshell, in case you haven't, is.

Develop underwater token. Developer

locks up a certain amount of token.

Developer can only take the token back

when the project reaches a certain price.

Developer then is super incentivized for

the token to reach a certain price and he

cannot take his ball and leave. He can

leave if he wants to, but if he does, he

is leaving that

reward in the.

In the vesting project, if the project

dies, his portion of it dies with it.

When we have NFTS, the developer will

get an NFT, which makes the community

take over of any type much

more viable. The developer

can then give the NFT to whoever decides

to take over a project, and if they trust

that developer not hiding another massive

amount of tokens elsewhere, which they

can verify to a degree by using bubble

maps, they can at least mitigate it. Then

they may buy the dev rights off of

that guy and get the NFT. And then when I

had to reach a certain light, then this

new death can claim his

rewards. That is, in a nutshell,

what Cryptosy Rest will be doing. We are

going to be building this regardless. So

if you're watching this video because of

a grant and you're considering whether or

not to allow the

grant. We're

kind of oxygen out of courtesy. We're

already building on networks where we are

free to build anyway, so we are going to

deploy on the network anyway. Regardless

of whether or not you offer the grant, of

course the grant will be nice. It will

help us to add bells and whistles. We can

pay for marketing or we can pay to

have business developers reach out to

other projects within that ecosystem.

And also it's, it's more of a

sign that you want us on the

network, you want this product on the

network and we go

to where we are loved. As

humans, we just do so.

I've been crypto see you have been

beautiful and hopefully

I will see you in the next episode where

we will discuss the brand

and everything around that, which at

this moment of time is actually complete.

And I think we can

see the logo up here just as a

here's one we produced earlier. And

this is going to be the the look

of the site or the look of the brand.

So facts watching and I will see

you in the next one please.
