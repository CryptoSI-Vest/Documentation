Hello and welcome to Kryptosi Vest 2.

This is a, I guess, state of the project

video. We're going to release these

videos along every step

of the way until Cryptosy Vest is

complete. This is the second

episode. For the first episode, I guess

you can go into description below. I'll

put the first episode there, but.

A quick recap, Kryptosi Vest is

you can almost ignore this

website we've got over this side

here. You can always ignore it because

it's a quick thing I had made-up

by AI. So the

the final landing page will not look like

this. Just using this as a placeholder

for now. So the website

we've bought the domain will be

cryptosyvest dot tech.

Cryptosyst is a tool to

shield you against rug pools. And

it is completely decentralisable. It will

be completely decentralised when it's

complete. Currently we are in the

development stage. We are just in the

second stage of development out of the

9 or 10 stages that I like to, I

like to put and in this short video,

what we're going to do is go through the

stages of development that there will be

in the future, as well as

rounding up what's going to happen in

this particular station at this

particular stage is the. Picking

of the team who from the cryptosy

team will be the people

to create and bring this

cryptosyvest project to life.

So in this.

First thing we'll do is go through the

steps, then we'll cover the team. So the

steps are as follows. We developed

the logo and the brand.

No need to do a video for that really.

The the logo is a Logan a brand is the

brand. I will show you the logo very

quickly though this will be the logo

moving forward. And obviously the

brand will be based around this

particular symbol will be the logo

and this font

anti rug platform is the the line.

So we know what it is we're doing

so. Let's go

to Yeah. So after

that we will make a video about.

Or hold on, maybe we've got we'll make a

video about the team, which is really

what we're making now. Then we're going

to show you the logic document. Logic

document is actually currently finished,

but we won't show you that in this video.

I'll make another video about that at a

later date. There might be some

changes needed to the logic document,

maybe a few little tweaks here and there.

We'll then create wireframes. Of course,

the logic document will show. How a

person will navigate through the

application?The wire frames then brings

that to life. So the wire frames are also

completed. We're currently working on the

front end Figma, which will be the

designs, exactly how the app will

look. We will create the smart contracts.

That's going to be done by our developer.

We will reveal who the developer will be

very soon, integrate the

two together. So front end and

the smart contracts get integrated

together. There will be a back end,

but it will be a system so that.

It's fully decentralised. Anybody can

spin up their own back end. Anybody can

have their own database and run their own

version of Cryptosyst.

We'll then go through testing. Testing

will be done mostly by myself. I'll see

if I can get some help and usability from

the lights of Chocker Block, people like

that. And then we launch.

Then we start to consider future

features. So who will

be the developer

for this particular project?

And the developer will be

this man. His name is

Snowman, also known as Bino.

He has done quite a lot of work for us in

the past prior to going

AWOL and then coming back.

We can see his befores and his after.

He's not actually on the team

page at the moment, but we will put

him on there prior to

obviously paying him.

He'll take one of these two placeholder

spaces here, so he'll take over Jane

Smith or Tom Black because those people

don't actually exist. A

little spoiler there with Amidas. So

this will be our developer if we go and

have a brief look, we can see in our

GitHub for Bitify. He

was Snowman 108. Heis now buying no

snow. He has added

by it now. He's done quite a lot of work

on bit of Fire actually, and he also done

quite a lot of work on Ruby swap so.

Decent developer I would say. Possibly

not our best but.

Definitely more than capable of

handling this project

that we are currently building. Of course

everything that he builds will be open

source and everything that he builds will

be audited. And realistically

the whole point in decentralised open

sourcesoftware is

that we're not trusting the person who

developed it. That's the reason why we

have verified contracts and that's the

reason why we have. Code audits.

So we will be going through all of those

things. Before the platform

is launched. So Bino

will be albino will be

the developer behind it here he is here

we there is already a

YouTube video with Bino

where you get to CNB interviewed by

myself. That is me that gorgeous man

there on the left hand side rocking my

signature higher on base

cap and.

Yeah, so. If you want

to know more about the developer, just go

and check him out videos there

on our YouTube. It's under the Crypto C

team. Bunch of videos

so that shouldn't shouldn't be too hard

to find. We

also need a person who will be

in charge of doing the design,

and that person is drum

roll, Please Amide. There's Timothy,

known in our discord as Figo

Lord. He's done quite a lot of design

work for us before. He's a Nigerian man,

very, very talented designer,

hard working and

definitely somebody who we can rely

on to bring. A nice

vibrant. Wireframe to

life. So we are

delighted to have him available for

this project. I really think that gives

us a good chance to have a very, very

nice front end for our

first. Minimum viable

product. So very, very happy to have

Amidas on board or Figo Lord on

board. He has worked with us before

on Sunak means.

I think that's the only roject he's

worked with us on O This will be his

second time but we were hay with what we

got for cine memes so hopefully he can

deliver the same standard of work and we

can have a beautiful front end.

Asides from that, I think

that pretty much is it as far as

testing is concerned. Like I said, it

will more than likely be me doing the

testing. If you are interested in

testing, obviously you could join our

discord as well as if you are

interested in joining the team or being a

part of this project, please join our

discord. Everything we do always build in

the open so anybody who wants to

chip in can chip in. Being paid,

obviously, is a different beast

altogether. We are trying

to eliminate

fraudulent efforts to be

paid by people who are not actually

developers, which is the reason why the

whole Cryptosy team came about, so that

only the verified people can get paid.

And we verify them obviously by having a

video with them. And I'm never paying the

same address. So that's the team that's

going to be the team behind.

Crypto C vest hopefully we should

continue to.

Build at this rapid pace, we're

aiming for AQ1 launch.

It's looking dicey at the moment,

probably be Q2 at this point

realistically, but the smart contract

development is underway, the wireframes

are complete and the design is now being

created so.

With any luck, we should be able to

release in Q1 or maybe Q2,

robably Q2. Anyway, thanks for watching.

If you are interested in this project at

all, make sure you follow me on Twitter.

Alternatively, you can join our Discord.

I will put the link in the description

below and away from that. Thanks

for watching and I look forward to seeing

you using the Crypto C

REST platform. Peace.
