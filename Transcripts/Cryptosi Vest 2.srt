00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:03,730
Hello and welcome to Kryptosi Vest 2.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,490
This is a, I guess, state of the project

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,650
video. We're going to release these

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,490
videos along every step

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,450
of the way until Cryptosy Vest is

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,010
complete. This is the second

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,930
episode. For the first episode, I guess

8
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,690
you can go into description below. I'll

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,330
put the first episode there, but.

10
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,070
A quick recap, Kryptosi Vest is

11
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,910
you can almost ignore this

12
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,670
website we've got over this side

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,510
here. You can always ignore it because

14
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,630
it's a quick thing I had made-up

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,710
by AI. So the

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,710
the final landing page will not look like

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,230
this. Just using this as a placeholder

18
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,910
for now. So the website

19
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,830
we've bought the domain will be

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,070
cryptosyvest dot tech.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,560
Cryptosyst is a tool to

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,390
shield you against rug pools. And

23
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,870
it is completely decentralisable. It will

24
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,470
be completely decentralised when it's

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,590
complete. Currently we are in the

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,550
development stage. We are just in the

27
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,350
second stage of development out of the

28
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,390
 9 or 10 stages that I like to, I

29
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,190
like to put and in this short video,

30
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,190
what we're going to do is go through the

31
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,550
stages of development that there will be

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,870
in the future, as well as

33
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,590
rounding up what's going to happen in

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,830
this particular station at this

35
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,430
particular stage is the. Picking

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,390
of the team who from the cryptosy

37
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:35,030
team will be the people

38
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,510
to create and bring this

39
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,470
cryptosyvest project to life.

40
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,670
So in this.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,280
First thing we'll do is go through the

42
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,640
steps, then we'll cover the team. So the

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,480
steps are as follows. We developed

44
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,640
the logo and the brand.

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
No need to do a video for that really.

46
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,870
The the logo is a Logan a brand is the

47
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,510
brand. I will show you the logo very

48
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,990
quickly though this will be the logo

49
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,950
moving forward. And obviously the

50
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,710
brand will be based around this

51
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,030
particular symbol will be the logo

52
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,550
and this font

53
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,950
anti rug platform is the the line.

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,710
So we know what it is we're doing

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,640
so. Let's go

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,280
to Yeah. So after

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,840
that we will make a video about.

58
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,990
Or hold on, maybe we've got we'll make a

59
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,110
video about the team, which is really

60
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,310
what we're making now. Then we're going

61
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,510
to show you the logic document. Logic

62
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,270
document is actually currently finished,

63
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,430
but we won't show you that in this video.

64
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,950
I'll make another video about that at a

65
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,750
later date. There might be some

66
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,710
changes needed to the logic document,

67
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,870
maybe a few little tweaks here and there.

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,830
We'll then create wireframes. Of course,

69
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,320
the logic document will show. How a

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,200
person will navigate through the

71
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,150
application?The wire frames then brings

72
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,230
that to life. So the wire frames are also

73
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,710
completed. We're currently working on the

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,990
front end Figma, which will be the

75
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,750
designs, exactly how the app will

76
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,590
look. We will create the smart contracts.

77
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,150
That's going to be done by our developer.

78
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,030
We will reveal who the developer will be

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,590
very soon, integrate the

80
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,750
two together. So front end and

81
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,430
the smart contracts get integrated

82
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,800
together. There will be a back end,

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,360
but it will be a system so that.

84
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,870
It's fully decentralised. Anybody can

85
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,870
spin up their own back end. Anybody can

86
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,990
have their own database and run their own

87
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,270
version of Cryptosyst.

88
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,000
We'll then go through testing. Testing

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,840
will be done mostly by myself. I'll see

90
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,240
if I can get some help and usability from

91
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,320
the lights of Chocker Block, people like

92
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,240
that. And then we launch.

93
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
Then we start to consider future

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,600
features. So who will

95
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,080
be the developer

96
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,600
for this particular project?

97
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,950
And the developer will be

98
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,030
this man. His name is

99
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,670
Snowman, also known as Bino.

100
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,590
He has done quite a lot of work for us in

101
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,230
the past prior to going

102
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,030
AWOL and then coming back.

103
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,390
We can see his befores and his after.

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,990
He's not actually on the team

105
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,950
page at the moment, but we will put

106
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,470
him on there prior to

107
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,990
obviously paying him.

108
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,160
He'll take one of these two placeholder

109
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,560
spaces here, so he'll take over Jane

110
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,040
Smith or Tom Black because those people

111
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,840
don't actually exist. A

112
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,400
little spoiler there with Amidas. So

113
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,400
this will be our developer if we go and

114
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,240
have a brief look, we can see in our

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
GitHub for Bitify. He

116
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,920
was Snowman 108.  Heis now buying no

117
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,800
snow. He has added

118
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,520
by it now. He's done quite a lot of work

119
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,680
on bit of Fire actually, and he also done

120
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,520
quite a lot of work on Ruby swap so.

121
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,040
Decent developer I would say. Possibly

122
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,560
not our best but.

123
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,030
Definitely more than capable of

124
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,670
handling this project

125
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,990
that we are currently building. Of course

126
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,310
everything that he builds will be open

127
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,470
source and everything that he builds will

128
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,990
be audited. And realistically

129
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,870
the whole point in decentralised open

130
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,310
 sourcesoftware is

131
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,350
that we're not trusting the person who

132
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,110
developed it. That's the reason why we

133
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,790
have verified contracts and that's the

134
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,400
reason why we have. Code audits.

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,280
So we will be going through all of those

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,240
things. Before the platform

137
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,160
is launched. So Bino

138
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,080
will be albino will be

139
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,360
the developer behind it here he is here

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
we there is already a

141
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,880
YouTube video with Bino

142
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,400
where you get to CNB interviewed by

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,680
myself. That is me that gorgeous man

144
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,400
there on the left hand side rocking my

145
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,920
signature higher on base

146
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,120
cap and.

147
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,870
Yeah, so. If you want

148
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,430
to know more about the developer, just go

149
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,230
and check him out videos there

150
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,030
on our YouTube. It's under the Crypto C

151
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,000
team. Bunch of videos

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,160
so that shouldn't shouldn't be too hard

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,670
to find. We

154
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,390
also need a person who will be

155
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,470
in charge of doing the design,

156
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,430
and that person is drum

157
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,310
roll, Please Amide. There's Timothy,

158
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,950
known in our discord as Figo

159
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,470
Lord. He's done quite a lot of design

160
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,270
work for us before. He's a Nigerian man,

161
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,110
very, very talented designer,

162
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,990
hard working and

163
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,310
definitely somebody who we can rely

164
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,920
on to bring. A nice

165
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,910
vibrant. Wireframe to

166
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,150
life. So we are

167
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,270
delighted to have him available for

168
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,390
this project. I really think that gives

169
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,990
us a good chance to have a very, very

170
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,910
nice front end for our

171
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,120
first. Minimum viable

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
product. So very, very happy to have

173
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,840
Amidas on board or Figo Lord on

174
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,800
board. He has worked with us before

175
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,920
on Sunak means.

176
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,180
I think that's the only roject he's

177
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,540
worked with us on O This will be his

178
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,300
second time but we were hay with what we

179
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,780
got for cine memes so hopefully he can

180
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,980
deliver the same standard of work and we

181
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,500
can have a beautiful front end.

182
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,390
Asides from that, I think

183
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,630
that pretty much is it as far as

184
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,990
testing is concerned. Like I said, it

185
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,310
will more than likely be me doing the

186
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,830
testing. If you are interested in

187
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,230
testing, obviously you could join our

188
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,870
discord as well as if you are

189
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,830
interested in joining the team or being a

190
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,910
part of this project, please join our

191
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,710
discord. Everything we do always build in

192
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,470
the open so anybody who wants to

193
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:15,280
chip in can chip in. Being paid,

194
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,120
obviously, is a different beast

195
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,790
altogether. We are trying

196
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,750
to eliminate

197
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,590
fraudulent efforts to be

198
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,070
paid by people who are not actually

199
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,790
developers, which is the reason why the

200
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,470
whole Cryptosy team came about, so that

201
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,390
only the verified people can get paid.

202
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,030
And we verify them obviously by having a

203
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,790
video with them. And I'm never paying the

204
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:40,710
same address. So that's the team that's

205
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,390
going to be the team behind.

206
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,560
Crypto C vest hopefully we should

207
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,000
continue to.

208
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,230
Build at this rapid pace, we're

209
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,550
aiming for AQ1 launch.

210
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,110
It's looking dicey at the moment,

211
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,070
probably be Q2 at this point

212
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,470
realistically, but the smart contract

213
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,390
development is underway, the wireframes

214
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,990
are complete and the design is now being

215
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,310
created so.

216
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,450
With any luck, we should be able to

217
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:14,970
release in Q1 or maybe Q2,

218
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,690
robably Q2. Anyway, thanks for watching.

219
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,930

225
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,650
you using the Crypto C

226
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,610
REST platform. Peace.
